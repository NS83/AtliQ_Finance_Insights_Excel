# AtliQ_Finance_Insights_Excel

This is an extension of the Sales Insight Report for AtliQ, where I had an opportunity to create a comprehensive P&L Report for the company. The goal was to compare key metrics by fiscal year, including a comparison of the numbers to the provided targets, and by fiscal months for each year.
